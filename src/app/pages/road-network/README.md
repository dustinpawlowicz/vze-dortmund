# Road network
The Road network page is a component which acts as the central 'home' page and provides an interactive map. This interactive map uses the Leaflet Library and displays the road network of the city of Dortmund with its nodes and edges on a map.<br />
The aim of this map is the selection and localization of an edge, which is used as a basis for the visual registration of road conditions.

## Documentation

**Notice:** The documentation within the corresponding 'page.ts' is to be used for the component's own methods.

### RoadNetworkService
A service that serves the purpose of delegating any interactions with 'Nodes' or 'Edges', as well as 'Leaflet' and exchanging the corresponding information between classes.

#### Imports
```typescript
import { RoadNetworkService } from './../../services/road-network/road-network.service';
```

#### Methods
Observe the GeoJSON nodes for any changes:
```typescript
RoadNetworkService.getGeoJsonNodes(): Observable<any>
```

Observe the GeoJSON edges for any changes:
```typescript
RoadNetworkService.getGeoJsonEdges(): Observable<any>
```

Observe the nodes for any changes:
```typescript
RoadNetworkService.getEdges(): Observable<Edge[]>
```

Check if the location permissions are granted:
```typescript
(method) RoadNetworkService.locationPermissionGranted(): Promise<boolean>
```

Checks whether the user has switched on the location check of the device:
```typescript
RoadNetworkService.locationActivated(): Promise<boolean>
```

Watch the current device's position.:
```typescript
RoadNetworkService.watchPosition(): Observable<Geoposition>
```

### HelperService
A service that provides general helper methods which are widely used.<br />
For further details please navigate to the respective service.

#### Imports
```typescript
import { HelperService } from './../../services/helper/helper.service';
```

Error handling by displaying an error message:
```typescript
HelperService.handleError(error: any): void
```

### RoadConditionRecordingService
A service used to provide the necessary data for road condition monitoring, to ensure data exchange between road condition monitoring classes and to handle the final data storage.

#### Imports
```typescript
import { RoadConditionRecordingService } from './../../services/road-condition-recording/road-condition-recording.service';
```

#### Methods
Prepare the visual recording by having the service set and fetch all necessary data:
```typescript
RoadConditionRecordingService.prepareRecording(edge: Edge): Promise<boolean>
```

### SettingsService
A service that stores and provides all user-specific settings on the current device.

#### Imports
```typescript
import { SettingsService } from './../../services/settings/settings.service';
```

#### Methods
Get a specific setting using the key:
```typescript
SettingsService.getSetting(key: string): Promise<any>
```
